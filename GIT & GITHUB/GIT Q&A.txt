GIT and GITHUB

1) what will happen if we do git fetch

	git fetch + git merge = git pull
	
2) Git merge vs git rebase

	git merge : a new commit will be created and branches get merged
	git rebase : a linear form of commits gets created
	
	newer commits will be places last in the git history
	older commits will be formed in first position

3) explain the branching strategy that are using in your organization

5) how can we clone only specific branch

6) what is git cherry pick ?
