Jenkins:

1) while running a job in jenkins build got failed, how will you resolve ?
    
		goto to console output--identify the error and rectify
		
		REASON of failure : tools configuration issus, plugin issues, code etc
		
	
2) how do you store secrets in jenkins and how to use them in pipelines



# Jenkins Scenario-Based Interview Questions and Answers

## Scenario 1
* How would you set up a Jenkins job to automatically trigger a build whenever changes are pushed to a Git repository?

**Answer**:

To achieve this, I would configure a Jenkins job with a Git source repository as its source control. Then, I would enable the "Poll SCM" option in the job configuration, specifying the frequency at which Jenkins should check for changes. Additionally, I could utilize webhooks in the Git repository to notify Jenkins of changes immediately, avoiding polling delays. 


## Scenario 2
* You have a Jenkins pipeline job that deploys an application to a testing environment. How would you integrate automated testing into this pipeline?

**Answer**:

I would add a testing stage to the Jenkins pipeline after the deployment stage.
Within this stage, I would incorporate automated tests using testing frameworks such as
JUnit, Selenium, or other relevant tools. The pipeline would execute these tests on the 
deployed application, providing feedback on its functionality and quality. 

## Scenario 3
* You're experiencing failures in your Jenkins builds. How would you investigate and troubleshoot these failures?

**Answer**:

I would start by examining the build logs and console output to identify any 
error messages or warnings. Additionally, I would check the Jenkins system logs for any 
relevant information. If the failures are intermittent, I might analyze environmental
factors, such as resource constraints or network issues. Furthermore, I could enable more
verbose logging or debugging options in Jenkins to capture additional details about the
failures.

## Scenario 4
* Your Jenkins server is running low on disk space. How would you address this issue?

**Answer**:
Firstly, I would identify any unnecessary build artifacts or old build data that can be safely deleted to reclaim disk space. Jenkins provides options to automatically discard old build data or artifacts after a certain period. Additionally, I might consider offloading build artifacts to external storage solutions or increasing the storage capacity of the Jenkins server if feasible.

## Scenario 5
* You need to parameterize a Jenkins job to accept user input during execution. How would you implement this?

**Answer**:

I would configure the Jenkins job to accept parameters, specifying the types of parameters (e.g., string, boolean, choice). These parameters could be defined directly in the job configuration or loaded from external sources such as Jenkinsfiles or Jenkins plugins. During job execution, Jenkins would prompt the user to input values for these parameters, which would then be used in the job's execution logic.
